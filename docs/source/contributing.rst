Contributing
============

We are happy to take contributions! It is best to get in touch with the maintainers about larger features or design changes before starting the work, as it will make the process of accepting changes smoother.

Everyone who contributes code to Raster Vision will be asked to sign the Azavea CLA, which is based off of the Apache CLA.
